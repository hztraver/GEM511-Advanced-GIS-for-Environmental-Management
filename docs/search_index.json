To do this you will use a Digital Elevation Model and high-resolution basemaps. The deliverable for this assignment will be a written report where you will assess the application of DEMs for forest management in riparian regions. Learning Objectives Understand the hydrology toolbox in ArcGIS Pro Execute tasks using Python scripting Research current forest management practices in BC Lab Background Riparian areas are found adjacent streams, lakes and wetlands. In many areas they contain highly productive and commercially valuable timber. However, vegetation in riparian zones also has important ecological function by stabilizing stream banks, regulating water temperature, providing nutrient inputs and reducing runoff into water bodies. In BC, Riparian Management Areas (RMAs) are defined around sensitive streams and rivers that forbid or limit forest harvest activities within them. The width of these buffer zones depend on stream class, which are defined by channel width and fish-bearing potential. Thus, it is critical for forest managers to accurately map and measure stream networks. (Stackhouse et al., 2023) Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) can be used to derive detailed maps of terrain and vegetation structure to aid in riparian forest management. Previous work has been done using ALS to map and extract stream characteristics over large areas and assign stream classes (Tompalski et al., 2017). You will use similar methods to classify streams and define RMAs over a small area in the Nahmint valley, BC.

Reference to at least 3 peer review sources (can be the same sources as introduction). Data The data for this lab are a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the Nahmint watershed region in British Columbia and is accessible via the UBC PostgreSQL server. Instructions for connecting to the server are given in the tasks below. We will be using data from the nahmint database. Task 1: Prepare the DEM and Map Stream Networks Step 1: The following steps should largely be review from the previous terrain modelling assignment! First, connect to the nahmint database on the UBC PostgreSQL server and import the Nahmint_DEM layer into your ArcGIS Pro project. We will do a few pre-processing steps before generating a stream network. Use the Fill tool to remove any sinks from the DEM. Sinks are small imperfections in the DEM that create areas where water cannot flow out of. If sinks are not eliminated, water flow can get trapped within these depressions, leading to unrealistic pooling of water and incorrect delineation of watershed boundaries. Navigate to Analysis &gt; Tools &gt; Fill (Spatial Analyst). Input Surface Raster: Nahmint_DEM Output Surface Raster: Nahmint_fill Z limit: leave blank The Z-limit represents the minimum depth of sinks that will be filled. For example, if it is set to 10 m then only sinks deeper than 10 m will be filled. For now leave this field blank, this will fill all sinks in the data. Step 2: Use the “Flow Direction” tool to to calculate the direction of water flow across the landscape. Use the following parameters for the tool: Input surface raster: Nahmint_fill Output flow direction raster: Nahmint_FlowDir Flow Direction Type: D8 Leave the rest blank/unchecked There are three flow modelling algorithms, but we will use the simplest: D8. In this model water will flow from one cell to its steepest downslope neighbour. The cell will then be assigned a value based on which of its 8 neighbours water will flow into. Click Run. You should now have something like the image below: What direction is water flowing at locations A and B? Why do you think this is the case? What topographic features can be seen interpreted from the flow direction raster? Consider these questions when writing your report discussion. Step 3: We will use the flow direction raster calculated in the last step to calculate flow accumulation, which counts the total number of cells that will flow into a given cell. For example, a cell located at the bottom of the hill will have high flow accumulation and a cell at the top of a hill will not have any flow accumulation. Open the “Flow Accumulation” tool and parameterize it as follows: Input flow direction raster: Nahmint_FlowDir Output flow accumulation raster: FlowAcc Output data type: Integer Input flow direction type: D8 Leave all other fields blank then run the tool. Step 4: Next, we will create a raster-based stream network using a threshold in the flow accumulation raster. For example, if the threshold is 100, then only cells with flow accumulation greater than 100 will be counted as a stream. Cells with flow accumulation less than 100 will be set to a background value of 0. To see how different thresholds impact stream identification, change the symbology of the flow accumulation raster and use the Manual Interval symbology to set two classes. See the example below for a stream network with a flow accumulation threshold of 100 (cells with flow accumulation &lt; 100 are set to no color). Compare your stream network to the streams visible in the ArcGIS satellite basemap. Experiment with different flow accumulation thresholds. What other features could be misclassified as a stream using this method? Find a threshold that captures streams visible in the basemap, without too many misclassified features. Once you have selected a threshold, open the “Reclassify (Spatial Analyst Tools)” tool. Use the threshold you have selected as the Start and End values. Set the cells representing streams to a “New value” of 1 and all other cells to NODATA. Save the new raster as “Stream_reclass”. Include your threshold value in the report Methods section. Zoom into the reclassified flow accumulation raster to see your stream network. Step 5: Next, we will assign a stream order to each segment in the stream network. Stream ordering is a system to classify streams based on the number of tributaries (smaller streams) that flow into it. First order streams have no tributaries and higher order streams may have multiple levels of tributaries flowing into it. Read the following documentation on the Strahler and Shreve methods of stream ordering. https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/how-stream-order-works.htm Open the “Stream Order” tool and parameterize it as follows: Input stream raster: Stream_reclass Input flow direction raster: Nahmint_FlowDir Method of stream ordering: Strahler Output raster: StreamOrder Zoom in to see the StreamOrder output. The value of each pixel corresponds to the order of each stream segment. Now re-run the tool using the Shreve method and compare the two outputs. Which one produces a more meaningful output and why? In the methods section of your report justify the use of the Stahler method for mapping this stream network. Step 6: Use the “Stream to Feature (Spatial Analyst Tools)” tool to create polyline features representing the ordered stream network. Parameterize the tool as follows: Input stream raster: StreamOrder Input flow direction raster: Nahmint_FlowDir Output polyline features: StreamNetwork_polyline Simplify polylines: Checked Open the polyline attribute table. The “grid_code” field corresponds to the stream order of the segment. The tool also generates attributes describing the start and end points of each segment and the segment length. Step 7: Finally, we will assign a unique ID to each stream segment using the “Stream Link” tool. Parameterize the tool as follows: Input stream raster: Stream_reclass Input flow direction raster: Nahmint_FlowDir Output raster: StreamLinks Zoom in and examine the output. Task 2: Extract Stream Characteristics In this task we will calculate stream gradient and estimate width for each segment in the network. These metrics will be used to assign a stream class and define the width of the riparian management area. Gradient is a measure of the streams “steepness” and is calculated as: \\[ \\frac{EC}{SL}*100 \\] \\(EC\\) is elevation change \\(SL\\) is stream length Streams with a gradient &lt;20% are considered “fish bearing” in the absence of other field data. Step 1: First, use the “Raster Calculator” tool to multiply the classified flow accumulation layer Stream_reclass and the Nahmint_DEM layer. This will give elevation within streams. Step 2: Open the “Zonal Statistics” tool. This tool calculates summary statistics in one raster layer within “zones” or groups defined in another layer. This is a very useful tool for many applications! We will use the unique IDs from the StreamLinks layer as “zones” to calculate the range in elevation within each stream segment. The resulting raster shows the gain in elevation within each stream segment. Step 3: We will convert the elevation change raster to polygon using the “Raster to Polygon” tool. Save the output as gradient_polygon. This step will allow us to perform a spatial join with the vectorized stream network. Open the attribute table and note that some attribute names are the same as the StreamNetwork_polyline. The attribute “grid_code” represents the elevation gain within each stream segment. Step 4: Open the “Spatial Join” tool and join the StreamNetwork_polyline with the gradient_polygon. Parameterize the tool as follows: Target Features: StreamNetwork_polyline Join Features: gradient_polyline Output Feature Class: StreamNetwork_join Join operation: Join one to one Keep all target features: Checked Match Option: Largest Overlap Search Radius: 3 Meters Include a rationale for using “Largest Overlap” as the “Match Option” in the Methods section of your report. Step 5: Open the attribute table of the output feature class. Notice the duplicated attribute names. The attributes are ordered with the attributes from the Target Feature first and the Join Features second. You may rename and delete unnecessary attributes. Create a new field called “Gradient” and use the “Calculate Field” tool to calculate the gradient for each stream segment. Streams with gradient &lt; 20% will be considered as “fish bearing”. Step 6: Next, we will use the ESRI basemaps to measure stream width for a sample of streams stratified by order. We will use the average stream width per order to approximate the width for all streams in the study area. (For example, if the average width of streams in order 1 is 30 m, all streams in order 1 will be assigned that width). Stream width is defined using the entire channel width, not just the part with water currently flowing through it. Use the examples below to guide you with your mapping. You should be able to see channels for streams in orders 2-4, but order 1 streams will likely not be visible. We will assign these streams an average width of 1 m. Measure 10-15 stream widths per order using the “Measure” tool on your toolbar and record these measurements in an excel document. When you are satisfied with your measurements calculate average width of each stream order. Use the DTM and stream network polyline to help you find some of the smaller order 2 streams. Step 7: In the StreamNetwork_join layer, create a new field called “StreamWidth”. We will use an ifelse statement to conditionally assign values to the stream width attribute depending on stream order. Select the “StreamWidth” column in the attribute table and click “Calculate”. In the “Calculate Field” tool, change the “Expression Type” to “Python”. To use Python in the tool we need to populate two fields. First, the top “Expression” field, which should read StreamWidth =. This is where we can call a function and define the inputs to the function. Here we have called the function reclass with the “StreamOrder” attribute as the input. Next, in the “Code Block” we need to define the reclass function, so that we can use it as part of an expression. Here we will use an ifelse statement to set the values of stream width based on stream order. Modify the following code and paste it into the “Code Block” (delete the square brackets before running). Verify the expression using the check button &gt; Apply. def reclass(Order): if (Order == 1): return [average stream width here] elif (Order == 2): return [average stream width here] elif (Order == 3): return [average stream width here] else: return [average stream width here] If you get an “Invalid Field” error it is because the variable in the “Expression Field” (between the !!) does not match a field in the attribute table. So make sure to match the name of the appropriate field. You can use the pre-generated Field names to generate your expression to make sure this step works, just double-click on one to add it to your expression. Task 3: Mapping Watersheds and Riparian Management Areas Step 1: Use the following table to assign a stream class (S1-S6) based on average channel width and fish bearing potential. The Reserve Zone defines the region around the stream where harvest is prohibited and the Management Zone defines the region where limited harvest is permitted. Note that not all stream classes may be present in the dataset. In the StreamNetwork_join layer, create a new attribute called “Reserve_BufferDist” and set the “Number Format” to “Numeric”. Select the “Reserve_BufferDist” field in the attribute table and open the “Calculate Field” tool. Change the “Expression Type” to “Python”. This time we will combine the ifelse syntax from the previous task with conditional statements to assign buffer distances to each stream class. The example below defines the Reserve Zone buffer distance for the S1 (except large rivers) class using the stream gradient and stream width attributes. The Reserve Zones and Management Zones are typically measured from the edge of the stream channel, however our streams are represented as lines down the centre of the stream channel. Think of a way to modify the buffer distances in the table to reflect the approximate width of the stream. Include these methods in your report. Your code should look something like the following (make sure the attribute names in the Expression field match the names in your table!): Use the following template in the “Code Block” to calculate the buffer distance for the remaining Reserve Zones (S1-S6). For classes with a width of 0 set the buffer distance to 0. def myCalc (gradient, width): if (gradient &lt; 20)and(width &gt;= 100): return 0 elif (gradient ...)and(width &gt; ... and width &lt; ...): ... else: return ... Repeat the same process for the Management Zone widths. Step 2: Open the “Buffer” tool and parameterize it as follows: Input Features: StreamNetwork_join Output Feature Class: Reserve_buffer Distance: Use drop-down menu to change to from Linear Unit to Field Reserve_BufferDist Side Type: Full End type: Round Dissolve: Dissolve all output features into a single feature Inspect the output. Repeat the Buffer step for the Management Zone widths. Step 3: Next, we will map watersheds. A watershed is an area of land where all the water that falls or flows into it converges to a common outlet, such as a river, lake, or ocean. It is bounded by a drainage divide, which separates water flowing into different watersheds. The watershed tool uses flow direction and stream links to delineate watershed boundaries. The watershed boundaries will be defined such that water flows into each of the stream links. Open the “Watershed” tool and parameterize it as follows: Input D8 flow direction raster: Nahmint_FlowDir Input raster or feature pour point data: StreamLinks Output raster: Nahmint_watersheds The output will be a new raster where the cell values correspond to each unique watershed catchment. You should have something like the following (do not worry if it is not exactly the same): Step 4: Finally, we will create contour lines to help interpret the the DTM. Open the “Contour” tool and parameterize it as follows: Raster: Nahmint_DEM Output features class: Nahmint_contour Contour interval: 100 Base contour: [Set to the lowest elevation in the study area] Z factor: 1 Contour type: Contour As your final deliverable create a map with the following elements: Watersheds, contour lines Stream networks symbolized by stream class Example stream network and Riparian Management Areas (Reserve Zone and Management Zone) Text showing the total area in the Reserve and Management Zone and the length of the stream network Name, date, legend, north arrow, scale bar, title Summary The aim of this lab was to practice solving a real-world forest management problem using raster and vector data.
